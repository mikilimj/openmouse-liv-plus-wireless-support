# Device artwork

Top-down product images shown in the persistent device panel. These are
**not committed to the repo** — they're hosted in the `openmouse-devices`
Cloudflare R2 bucket (public read via its r2.dev URL, upload access
restricted to maintainers) and served from
`DEVICE_IMAGE_BASE_URL` in `src/ui/device-images.ts`. This file stays as
the provenance/licensing record for every image that's been uploaded.

## Contributing artwork (no bucket access needed)

Only a maintainer can upload to the bucket, so don't open a PR with a binary
image file — it has nowhere to go. Instead:

1. Open a [Device artwork request](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/device-artwork.yml)
   issue with a direct link to a source image (a transparent PNG/WebP is
   ideal; a photo on a plain background is fine too) and what you know about
   its licensing.
2. Optionally, open a PR alongside it that adds the device's
   `vendorId:productId` → `<name>.png` entry to `src/ui/device-images.ts`
   (or the name-fallback regex, if the PID isn't pinned yet) using the
   filename you'd expect the art to get. The mapping can land before the
   file exists in the bucket — a missing file just fails at image-load time,
   not at build time, so it won't break the site.
3. A maintainer normalizes the image (transparent background, ~340px-wide
   product panel size), uploads it to the bucket, and adds the
   source/licensing note below.

## Maintainer upload steps

1. Save a **transparent** PNG or WebP named after the model in kebab-case,
   e.g. `razer-viper-v3-pro.png`. The panel sits on a dark background, so an
   image with a white backdrop shows as a white block.
2. Keep enough resolution for a product panel up to roughly 340 px wide.
3. Upload it to the bucket:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler r2 object put openmouse-devices/<name>.png --file=<name>.png --remote
   ```
   (requires `wrangler login` against the OpenMouse Cloudflare account first).
4. Map the device to it in `src/ui/device-images.ts`, keyed by
   `vendorId:productId` in lowercase hex — value is the bare filename, not a
   path. A mouse with separate wired and receiver product ids needs an entry
   for each.
5. Record the source/licensing note for the file below, for provenance.

## Licensing

`endorfy-liv-plus-wireless.png` is the unmodified transparent top-view render
from Endorfy's official LIV Plus Wireless software 1.0.0.4 (2025-03-14),
`app/res/2Button/dev1.png` inside its installer. Source:
<https://endorfy.com/cdn/shop/files/ENDORFY-LIV-Plus-Wireless-Software-2025-03-14.zip?v=10453208085035470114>.
It is served locally through `LOCAL_OVERRIDES` so this fork displays the
picture without maintainer access to R2. After an R2 upload, remove the local
override and file. Vendor product artwork; redistribution terms have not
been established, as with the vendor renders recorded below.

Vendor product renders are usually copyrighted marketing assets, and this
repository is public. Prefer artwork you made or can redistribute — a traced
silhouette is enough at this size — over an official render lifted from a
product page.

`logitech-pro-x-superlight-2c.png` was supplied for the redesign from Logitech's
official PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2c product gallery. Confirm redistribution terms
before including it in a public release package.

`logitech-pro-x2-superstrike.png` was supplied from Logitech G's official
PRO X2 SUPERSTRIKE product gallery
(`resource.logitechg.com/.../pro-x2-superstrike-pdp/2026/pro-x2-superstrike-top-angle-lifestyle-gallery-2.png`,
direct DAM file, transparent). Normalized to a 700×700 transparent canvas
(~600 px mouse, centered) to match the G502 set. Replaces an earlier R2 entry
that was a 16:9 lifestyle shot with an opaque green background. Confirm
redistribution terms before including it in a public release package.

`logitech-pro-x3-superstrike.png` was supplied from Logitech G's official
PRO X3 SUPERSTRIKE product gallery
(`resource.logitechg.com/.../pro-x3-superstrike-pdp/gallery/pro-x3-superstrike-mouse-midnight-black-top-angle-gallery-1.png`,
direct DAM file, transparent, Midnight Black hero SKU to distinguish it from
the white X2 render). Normalized to a 700×700 transparent canvas (~600 px
mouse, centered) to match the G502 set. **Needs a maintainer upload** — the
mapping in `src/ui/device-images.ts` keys on `superstrike` + `x 3` in the
reported name (receiver `0x046d:0xc54f`, mouse-protocol #117) and falls back
to a broken image until then. Confirm redistribution terms before including
it in a public release package.

The three `logitech-g502*.png` files were supplied from Lenovo, Logitech G,
and MyXprs product-image URLs. They were normalized to matching 700×700
transparent canvases; the original G502 backdrop was extracted from its source
render. Confirm redistribution terms before including them in a public release
package.

`logitech-g703.png` was supplied from Logitech G's official G703 HERO product
gallery (`resource.logitechg.com` DAM `g703-mouse-top-angle-gallery-1.png`)
and normalized to the same 700×700 transparent canvas as the G502 set. Confirm
redistribution terms before including it in a public release package.

`logitech-mx-master-4.png` is a line-art trace made for this repository, not a
vendor render. Only geometry derives from the source: the outer silhouette and
the shell seams — button split, scroll-wheel housing, thumb rest, thumb wheel,
side-panel crease and the wheel-mode button — were authored as paths against a
product image. No colour, shading, texture or lettering was carried over, and
the Logitech wordmark on the shell was deliberately excluded rather than faded,
since it is a trademark and this repository is public. This render is currently
parked (no acceptable re-render was sourced), so the MX Master 4 resolves to the
generic `unknown-device.png` placeholder until a clean render is supplied.

`endgame-gear-op1-8k.png` was supplied from an Overclockers UK product-image
URL for the OP1 8K. Confirm redistribution terms before including it in a
public release package.

`endgame-gear-op1we.png` was supplied from an Overclockers UK product-image
URL for the OP1we.

`razer-viper-v2-pro.png` was supplied from Razer's support FAQ device-layout
asset (`dl.razerzone.com/src/6048-1-en-v10.png`). Ideally replace it with a
higher-resolution image if one is found. Confirm redistribution terms before
including it in a public release package.

`razer-orochi-v2.png` was supplied from Razer's own product-image CDN
(`dl.razerzone.com/src/OrochiV2-1-en-v1.png`), keyed out of its white
backdrop and downscaled onto a transparent canvas. Confirm redistribution
terms before including it in a public release package.

`teevolution-terra-pro.png` was supplied from Teevolution's Terra PRO Shopify
CDN product render. Confirm redistribution terms before including it in a
public release package.

`crdrako-ko-one.png` was supplied from CRDRAKO's KO-ONE Shopify CDN product
render and converted to a transparent PNG. Confirm redistribution terms before
including it in a public release package.

`razer-viper-mini.webp` was supplied from a Discord attachment URL for the
Razer Viper Mini (wired). Confirm redistribution terms before including it in
a public release package.

`zaunkoenig-m3k.png` was supplied from the OpenMouse product-image storage URL
for Zaunkoenig M3K and is also used for the M2K entry. Confirm redistribution
terms before including it in a public release package.

`attackshark-r2.png` — the name-fallback mapping in `src/ui/device-images.ts`
is in place (keyed on the reported name "Attack Shark R2", since PID 0x402D is
shared with the Lingbao M5 Pro). The render was supplied from igEEKJO's
product page (`igeekjo.com` Shopify CDN,
`.../files/download_fc6e45b7-7ddb-40ad-89da-e75cab39120a.jpg`, fetched
2026), keyed out of its white backdrop and centered on a transparent 700×700
canvas.

**TEMPORARY checked-in copy.** To fix the overwritten artwork immediately,
the normalized `attackshark-r2.png` is committed at
`public/devices/attackshark-r2.png` and served from the repo via the
`LOCAL_OVERRIDES` map in `src/ui/device-images.ts` (it returns
`/devices/attackshark-r2.png` instead of the R2 URL). This is a stopgap, not
the final home. Until this file is in the bucket, the panel shows the repo
copy; an earlier unmoderated crowd upload overwrote the bucket entry with
unrelated artwork (a dog photo), which is why the bucket file must not be
trusted.

**Maintainer TODO (do once, then remove the stopgap):**
1. Upload the real render to the bucket:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler r2 object put openmouse-devices/attackshark-r2.png --file=public/devices/attackshark-r2.png --remote
   ```
2. Delete the leftover crowd objects (the dog picture lives under the `crowd/`
   prefix): in the Cloudflare dashboard, R2 → `openmouse-devices` → `crowd/` →
   select all → Delete, or delete each key with
   `npx wrangler r2 object delete openmouse-devices/crowd/<key>`.
3. Remove the stopgap: delete `LOCAL_OVERRIDES` from `src/ui/device-images.ts`,
   delete `public/devices/attackshark-r2.png`, and flip
   `device-images.test.ts` back to asserting `CDN + "attackshark-r2.png"`.
4. Keep this note as provenance. Vendor product art — treat as a request
   pending licensing review.

`noir-m2-nex.png` is reserved for the name-fallback mapping for Noir Gear's
M2-NEX. A local render from the vendor configurator may be used for development
previews, but it is deliberately not committed here. Before publishing the
asset, Noir Gear must confirm redistribution rights or OpenMouse should use a
maintainer-created silhouette instead.

`delux-m800-mini.png` — the name-fallback mapping in `src/ui/device-images.ts`
is in place (keyed on reported names like "Delux M800 Mini", "Delux M800 Pro",
"Delux M800 Mini (Wireless)"). The render was supplied from Delux's official
product portal (`deluxworld.com`, `/uploads/admin/image/20251226/M800mini黑.png`),
centered on a transparent 700×700 canvas.

`attackshark-r5-ultra.png` is the top-down render of the Attack Shark R5 Ultra
extracted from Attack Shark's official product gallery
(`cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0823/5050/6282/files/R5ULTRA_C06_3.png`), keyed
out of its white backdrop and downscaled. Confirm redistribution terms before
including it in a public release package.

`razer-viper.webp` was supplied from a Best Buy shopping page for the device. Confirm redistribution
terms before including it in a public release package.

`logitech-mx-master-3s.png` was supplied from Logitech's product CDN (MX Master
3S Bluetooth Edition graphite top view). Confirm redistribution terms before
including it in a public release package.

`pulsar-x2-v2.png` was supplied from Pulsar Gaming Gears' Japan CDN product
render for the X2 v2 [Red Edition] Gaming Mouse (top-down view of the Medium
shell), cropped to the mouse, resized, and centered on a transparent canvas.
Confirm redistribution terms before including it in a public release package.

`wlmouse-beast-max.png` is the black colorway, extracted from WL Mouse Hub
(`gm.wlmouse.gg`, the official WLMouse configurator) after pairing a Beast Max
over WebHID — the driver only serves the connected device's own product
renders, so this can't be fetched without real hardware. Confirm
redistribution terms before including it in a public release package.

The following were added to cover additional `supported` devices from the
support catalog, sourced from official brand/media CDNs and retailer product
renders, then normalized to transparent PNGs (white backgrounds keyed out where
needed). Confirm redistribution terms before including any in a public release
package:

- `logitech-g203.png` (G203 LIGHTSYNC / PRODIGY, G102 share the shell) — Logitech / retailer render
- `logitech-g402.png` — Logitech G402 render
- `logitech-g303.png` — Logitech G303 render
- `logitech-g403.png` — Logitech G403 render
- `logitech-g903.png` — Logitech G903 render
- `logitech-g305.png` — Logitech G305 LIGHTSPEED (G304 shares the shell)
- `logitech-g-pro.png` — Logitech G Pro (2017) / G Pro Hero / G Pro Wireless classic shell
- `logitech-g-pro-2.png` — Logitech G Pro 2
- `logitech-g309.png` — Logitech G309 Lightspeed
- `logitech-mx-anywhere-3.png` — Logitech MX Anywhere 3 top-view render
- `logitech-mx-ergo-s.png` — Logitech MX Ergo S top-view render
- `razer-deathadder-v2.png` — Razer DeathAdder V2 (V2 / V2 Pro / Essential share the shell)
- `razer-deathadder-v3.png` — Razer DeathAdder V3 render (V3 Pro shares the shell)
- `razer-deathadder-v4-pro.png` — Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro (Carbon Fiber SKU shares the shell)
- `razer-viper-v3-hyperspeed.png` — Razer Viper V3 HyperSpeed render
- `razer-viper-v4-pro.png` — Razer Viper V4 Pro render
- `endgame-gear-xm2-8k.png` — Endgame Gear XM2 8K top-down render
- `endgame-gear-xm2w.png` — Endgame Gear XM2w 4K top-down render
- `wlmouse-sword-x.png` — WLMouse Sword X render (Beast X / Beast Mini / Beast X Pro have no render yet; they resolve to the generic placeholder)
- `vgn-dragonfly-f2.png` — VGN Dragonfly F2 Master+ render
- `lamzu-maya-x.png` — Lamzu Maya X render
- `atk-f1-v2-ultra-max.png` — ATK F1 V2 Ultra Max render
- `finalmouse-ulx.png` — Finalmouse Starlight-12 / ULX low-profile shape render
- `mchose-a7-v2.png` — MCHOSE A7 V2 render, from MCHOSE's own M HUB configurator
  (`https://cdn.mchose.com.cn/configCenter/assets/img/mouse/A7V2Pro_white.png`).
  MCHOSE only publishes `A7V2Pro_*` renders and the Pro / Pro+ / Ultra / Ultra+
  are one shell, so this single image covers the whole A7 V2 family. **Needs a
  maintainer upload**, the mapping in `src/ui/device-images.ts` is already in
  place and falls back to the placeholder until then. Not yet cleared for
  licensing: it is vendor product art, so treat it as a request rather than an
  approved asset.
- `keychron-m6.png`: Keychron M6 (1K, PixArt 3395; PID 0x3434:0xd060, receiver
  0x3434:0xd029) render, from Keychron Launcher's own product catalogue
  (`https://sysmgr.keychron.cn/api/upload/cover/25/1751522970525.png`; a second
  angled view is at `.../1751522970560.png`). Transparent 2560×2560 PNG, needs
  the usual crop/downscale to the ~340 px panel size. **Needs a maintainer
  upload**, the mapping in `src/ui/device-images.ts` is in place and falls back
  to the placeholder until then. Vendor product art, not yet cleared for
  licensing, so treat it as a request rather than an approved asset.
- `vxe-r1-series.png` — shared by the VXE R1 family (R1, R1 SE, R1 SE+, R1 Pro,
  and R1 Pro Max), which use the same external shell. The render was extracted
  from ATK Hub, ATK/VXE's official device configurator, and normalized as a
  transparent PNG for the device panel. **Needs a maintainer upload**, the
  mapping in `src/ui/device-images.ts` is already in place and falls back
  cleanly until then. Vendor product art, not yet cleared for licensing, so
  treat it as a request rather than an approved asset.
- `mchose-a7-v3.png` — MCHOSE A7 V3 render. Same story as the V2 above:
  MCHOSE publishes only `A7V3Pro_*` renders and the four V3 models share a
  shell, so one image covers the family. **Needs a maintainer upload**, and
  carries the same unresolved licensing question.

- `dareu-a950-pro-mg.png` — **needs a maintainer upload.** The mapping covers
  the A950 PRO Mg mouse (`0x260d:0x1117`) and dedicated receiver
  (`0x260d:0x1114`). Suggested source: the contributor-supplied transparent
  render from Dareu's driver panel
  (`https://driver.dareu.com/allinone/products/1117/TM271F.png?v=1.3.24`). It
  is vendor product art; request licensing review before publishing it in R2.
